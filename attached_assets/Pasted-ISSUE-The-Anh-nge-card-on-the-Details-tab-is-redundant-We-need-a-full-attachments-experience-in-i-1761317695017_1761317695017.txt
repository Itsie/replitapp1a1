ISSUE
The "Anhänge" card on the Details tab is redundant. We need a full attachments experience in its own tab and remove the mini-card from Details. The tab should handle both print assets and generic files, support server path (UNC) and direct upload (drag&drop).

GOAL
- Rename tab "Druckdaten" to "Druckdaten / Anhänge".
- Implement full attachments manager in that tab:
  • Two asset types: PRINT (druckrelevant) and FILE (sonstiges)
  • Add via "server path" (UNC-style) OR file upload (drag & drop, multi)
  • List with preview/open, required flag for PRINT, delete
- Remove the "Anhänge" card from Details tab. Keep only a small button "Druckdaten öffnen" that navigates to the attachments tab.
- Keep existing production gate: submit is blocked if required PRINT assets are missing.

SCOPE
You ARE allowed to:
- Extend Prisma model for assets
- Add a single upload endpoint (multipart)
- Update client UI for the new tab
Do not refactor unrelated modules.

A) PRISMA (extend or create asset model)
Update prisma/schema.prisma:

model OrderAsset {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  orderId     String
  order       Order    @relation(fields: [orderId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  kind        String   // "PRINT" | "FILE"
  label       String
  // one of the following will be set
  path        String?  // internal UNC path like //server/share/folder/file.pdf
  url         String?  // hosted file url (uploaded to /uploads)
  ext         String?
  size        Int?     // bytes
  required    Boolean  @default(false)  // only relevant for PRINT
  notes       String?

  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  uploadedBy  String?  // optional user id/name
}

Run:
npx prisma migrate dev -n "extend_order_assets_for_uploads"
npx prisma generate

B) SERVER (Express)
1) Implement upload directory: /uploads/orders/:orderId
   - Ensure directory exists; reject files > 50MB
   - Sanitize filenames; store as original name with cuid prefix to avoid clashes

2) Endpoints under /api/orders/:id/assets
- GET    /api/orders/:id/assets
- POST   /api/orders/:id/assets
  body (JSON): { kind: "PRINT"|"FILE", label: string, path?: string, url?: string, required?: boolean, notes?: string }
  Rules:
   • Either path OR url is required. (url will be provided by upload endpoint)
   • If path is provided, validate UNC-like: startsWith("//") || "\\\\", normalize to double-slash in storage.
- POST   /api/orders/:id/assets/upload  (multipart/form-data, field: file, fields: kind, label, required?, notes?)
  Behavior:
   • Save file to /uploads/orders/:id/<generatedFilename>
   • Build public URL: /uploads/orders/:id/<generatedFilename> (served statically)
   • Create OrderAsset with url + ext + size + kind + label (+ required if PRINT)
   • Return 201 with saved asset
- DELETE /api/orders/:id/assets/:assetId
  • If asset has url under /uploads, delete the file on disk

3) Static serve
- Serve /uploads as static files

4) Production gate (already exists on submit): make sure it checks
   • At least one PRINT asset with (path OR url) present when department === "TEAMSPORT"
   • Otherwise do not block

C) CLIENT – Tab "Druckdaten / Anhänge"
- Rename the tab and move all attachments UI there. Remove the "Anhänge" card from the Details tab (keep only a small button that routes to the attachments tab).

Layout of the tab:
- Header actions:
  [ + Datei hochladen ]  [ + Server-Pfad hinzufügen ]  (segmented)
- Upload (shadcn + dropzone):
  • Drag & drop area + file picker
  • On drop: upload to POST /api/orders/:id/assets/upload (multipart)
  • Required toggle only shown when kind=PRINT
- Server-Pfad dialog:
  • Inputs:
     - Art: Select (PRINT, FILE)
     - Label: Text
     - Serverpfad (UNC): Text input with validation -> must start with // or \\ , value stored normalized as //server/...
     - Required (visible only if PRINT)
     - Notes (optional)
  • Save -> POST /api/orders/:id/assets (with kind, label, path, required?, notes)

List:
- Table columns:
  • Typ (Badge PRINT/FILE) 
  • Label
  • Quelle (Pfad oder Datei) – show icon: link for UNC path, file icon for uploads
  • Größe (falls vorhanden)
  • Erforderlich (✓/—)  only for PRINT
  • Erstellt am
  • Aktionen: Öffnen/Anzeigen, Kopieren des Pfads/URL, Löschen (mit confirm)
- Clicking Öffnen:
  • For url: open in new tab
  • For path: copy to clipboard and show tooltip "Interner Pfad kopiert"

Empty state:
- "Noch keine Anhänge. Laden Sie Dateien hoch oder fügen Sie einen Serverpfad hinzu."

D) DETAILS TAB
- Remove the current "Anhänge" card.
- In the right column (“Auftrag”) keep a small button: [Druckdaten öffnen] → routes to the “Druckdaten / Anhänge” tab.

E) ACCEPTANCE
- Uploading files creates OrderAsset with url under /uploads and is accessible.
- Adding a UNC path creates OrderAsset with path saved and normalized ("//server/share/...").
- TeamSport submit is blocked if there is no PRINT asset (path or url) → 412 as before.
- The list supports delete with actual file removal for uploaded files.
- The Details tab no longer contains attachments; the dedicated tab works for both PRINT and FILE assets.

Keep changes minimal and focused on this feature.
